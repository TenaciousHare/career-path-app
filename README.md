# Career Path app

## Purpose of the application

The purpose of this app is to test my React programming skills. While solving the tasks, I tried to use my experience gained <br> while creating other projects. I tried to perform them knowing that I am creating a more complicated system than what was<br> indicated in the task.
I used technologies that, in my opinion, should be used in larger projects.

## Changelog

# 0.2.0

1. The FormField component has been split into smaller components:

- FormField - default,
- SelectField - for selects,
- TextAreaField - for textareas,

2. Form validation has been enhanced with Yup Schema, errors are now passed from prop 'errors' and their display has been moved to the individual components.

3. Google Fonts are now imported in HTML file.

## ToDos

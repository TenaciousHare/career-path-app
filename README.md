# Career Path app

## Purpose of the application

The purpose of this app is to test my React programming skills. While solving the tasks, I tried to use my experience gained <br> while creating other projects. I tried to perform them knowing that I am creating a more complicated system than what was<br> indicated in the task.
I used technologies that, in my opinion, should be used in larger projects.

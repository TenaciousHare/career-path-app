        The purpose of this app is to test my React programming skills. While solving the tasks, I tried to use my experience gained while creating
        other projects. I tried to perform them knowing that I am creating a more complicated system than what was indicated in the task. I used
        technologies that, in my opinion, should be used in larger projects.
      </Paragraph>
    </Wrapper>
